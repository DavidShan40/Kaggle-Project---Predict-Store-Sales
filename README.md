# Kaggle-Project---Predict-Store-Sales
https://www.kaggle.com/c/w21proj1
This is my inclass project for statistical inference class, designed for undergraduate/master students (stat 457/857).

Provide a brief introduction of the goal of this task. First get to know the data, include some graphical displays, and comment on patterns/characteristics of the data you find interesting or relevant to your later analysis.

The emphasis of the project is on getting better prediction rules, and you will describe your effort on how to achieve this goal. For example, you may discuss how you create meaningful features, how to select tuning parameters for your algorithms, and how to combine different algorithms etc.

You are required to build at least three prediction models. Options include linear models, generalized additive models, random forests, boosting trees, and any other reasonable methods. Please note that these methods have to be different in nature. For example, the same algorithm with two different parameter configurations is counted as one. You will include a description of the methodology, as well as the implementation if it is not trivial. You should spend more time on methods you find promising in achieving good scores.

To sum up, these are what I included in the report:
A brief introduction
Exploratory data analysis
Descriptions and discussions on at least three prediction models
Your prediction scores on Kaggle
